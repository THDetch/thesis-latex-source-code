\section{Problem Statement}
Despite their effectiveness, these detectors are inherently too heavy for direct deployment on microcontrollers and other embedded systems without modification. In practical terms, deploying such models in autonomous vehicles or in smart city infrastructures require reducing their size and compute demands significantly. The key research question of this work is: \textit{Can high-performance pedestrian detection models be adapted for efficient, accurate inference on edge devices using post-training quantization, and what are the trade-offs in generalization, speed, memory, and energy consumption?}
