ABSTRACT = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been extensively applied in remote sensing applications. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to process and interpret SAR images. The key to interpreting SAR images lies in transforming them into other forms of remote sensing images to extract valuable hidden remote sensing information. Currently, the conversion of SAR images to optical images produces low-quality results and incomplete spectral information. To address these problems, an end-to-end network model, S2MS-GAN, is proposed for converting SAR images into multispectral images. In this process, to tackle the issues of noise and image generation quality, a TV-BM3D module is introduced into the generator model. Through TV regularization, block-matching, and 3D filtering, these two modules can preserve the edges and reduce the speckle noise in SAR images. In addition, spectral attention is added to improve the spectral features of the generated MS images. Furthermore, we construct a very high-resolution SAR-to-MS image dataset, S2MS-HR, with a spatial resolution of 0.3 m, which is currently the most comprehensive dataset available for high-resolution SAR-to-MS image interpretation. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on the relevant dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in translation performance. The solution effectively facilitates high-quality transitions of SAR images across different types.},
